England have hosted the most World Cups â€“ a total of 5 (including the first three World Cups). England has hosted 
the most number of World Cup alone, doing it in 1975 and 1979. In 1983 & 1999, despite being regarded as the only host for the tournament, 
some matches were played in Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland and Wales. India are the second nation to host the world cup alone in the 2023 edition. 
The West Indies hosted the tournament in 2007 but are not considered as sole hosts because the West Indies represents
a sporting confederation of 15 mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries, British dependencies and non-British dependencies.
